# Team Sync

Team Sync is a web app designed to help Junior Design students plan their schedules for future semesters. It simplifies the process of finding the best time slot for admin and ensres that everyone’s availability is considered.
# 🎓 Course Enrollment Web App (Capstone Project)

A full-stack **React + Next.js** course enrollment platform integrated with **Georgia Tech Single Sign-On (SSO)** and a **MySQL backend**, designed to serve over **8,000+ students per semester**.  
This project was built as part of our Software Engineering Capstone and deployed via **Plesk**, with a scalable architecture supporting real-time enrollment, admin management, and accessibility compliance.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This platform enables students and administrators to manage course enrollments efficiently.  
Students can register for course sections in teams, while administrators can view, edit, and assign students to appropriate sections through an interactive dashboard.

Although this repository hosts a **frontend copy**, it integrates with a **Node.js + MySQL** backend API in production.
